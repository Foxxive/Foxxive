hey, i'm vinny, though, a lot of people know me by the name Foxxive
i'm mostly known on youtube and discord, but you might have found me through another method, idk why you'd do that tho
so yeah, i like programming stuff, mainly useless things but sometimes i'll release a somewhat functional project
i start a lot of things and then i never finish them, bad habit o' mine
i try my best to be a good guy, i just wanna help whenever i can
i'm actually 16, but i guess it's more impressive to see someone who can do this and more while being 13

idk what else to put here, i'll probably update this often when i think of more stuff to put here
